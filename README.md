# DailyStocks

An application for the web that allows the user to search for a stock via its "ticket-name". The user gets results with % based on how good a match it is with the search.

When the user then presses the option that suits, the latest price for the stock comes up.

Then we have a news function that fetches the latest news depending on what the user presses. (Blockchain , Finance , IPO).

In this project I have used a stock API to retrieve the data. Check out the documentation for the api here:
